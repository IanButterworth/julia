Julia v1.4 Release Notes
========================

New language features
---------------------


Language changes
----------------


Multi-threading changes
-----------------------


Build system changes
--------------------


New library functions
---------------------

* The `splitpath` function now accepts any `AbstractString` whereas previously it only accepted paths of type `String` ([#33012]).


Standard library changes
------------------------

* `div` now accepts a rounding mode as the third argument, consistent with the corresponding argument to `rem`. Support for rounding division, by passing one of the RoundNearest modes to this function, was added. For future compatibility, library authors should now extend this function, rather than extending the two-argument `fld`/`cld`/`div` directly. ([#33040])
